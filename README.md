An interactive simulation where a Reinforcement Learning agent (PPO) monitors a virtual sepsis patient and takes real-time treatment actions—like fluids or antibiotics—to stabilize vitals and prevent deterioration. Built with Streamlit, it showcases how AI can assist in critical ICU decisions.

Our goal is to train an RL agent that:
Continuously monitors real-time ICU patient data
Learns when and how to intervene optimally
Prevents sepsis progression
Reduces mortality and improves patient outcomes
This project integrates real clinical data, machine learning, and simulation to support medical decisions and potentially save lives.
